## CryHam's Fork

This is my fork with many changes:
- Gameplay
   - New **keys** for player ship:  
     - *Backwards* accelerate
     - *Boost* - holding does faster acceleration
       and with left/right goes *sideways* instead of turning
     - Next, previous weapon change, at any time
   - 7 new **Weapons** - fast, excessive:  
     AFK-85, Plasma, H2OStorm, Flamer2, Shotgun2, MiniRockets, Rifle2
   - **Map Options**, with sliders for:  
     - min,max count of space objects (planets, stars, black holes)
     - and their radius range, minimal gap between
     - ship radius, home planet radius
   - **Game options** with sliders:
     - Damage scale, Respawn delay, Life and fuel regeneration
     - Ship turn speed, ship glow factor
   - more possible bots, more kills to end game
   - Ship thrusters now blue
   - ToDo: turrets, near team homes, or any middle, destroyable, respawned
- Gui
  - Scale slider for whole Gui in Options
  - bigger Gui, font
  - color Skyblue, not Pink-Red
  - fast fade in/out, no game countdown
  - option for no confirmation dialogs
  - no logo, planet signs
