## CryHam's Fork

This is my fork with **many new** features and changes, listed in [Changelog](changelog.md).


## About

**M.A.R.S. - a ridiculous shooter** is a 2D space shooter with awesome visual effects and attractive physics.  
Players can battle each other or computer controlled enemies in exciting game modes. 

Feel free to visit its *old homepage* at http://mars-game.sourceforge.net/


## The Story

In year 3547, civilizations all over the galaxy have settled their own planets,  
living in peace and harmony with its environment.  
But outside the contemplative habitats, the GREAT WAR is raging.  
As a famous fighter on your way to never ending honor and prosperity,  
you have to protect your planet from the oncoming doom of your jealous neighbours!


## Compiling and installing from source

For information on how to compile the game from source, please feel free to visit [BUILD.md](BUILD.md)


## Doxygen

Documentation for sources, class list, members, hierarchy, diagrams etc.  
can be generated using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/).  
Setup for it is in [Doxyfile](../Doxyfile).  
After installing Doxygen (and its needed deps for diagrams), start by `doxygen`.  
Then access it by opening created [doxygen/html/index.html](doxygen/html/index.html).
